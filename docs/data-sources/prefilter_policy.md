## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) The name of the FMC domain
- `id` (String) The id of the object
- `name` (String) The name of the prefilter policy.

### Read-Only

- `default_action` (String) Specifies the default action to take when none of the rules meet the conditions.
- `default_action_log_begin` (Boolean) Indicating whether the device will log events at the beginning of the connection.
- `default_action_log_end` (Boolean) Indicating whether the device will log events at the end of the connection.
- `default_action_send_events_to_fmc` (Boolean) Indicating whether the device will send events to the Firepower Management Center event viewer.
- `default_action_snmp_config_id` (String) UUID of the SNMP alert. Can be set only when either default_action_log_begin or default_action_log_end is true.
- `default_action_syslog_config_id` (String) UUID of the syslog config. Can be set only when either default_action_log_begin or default_action_log_end is true.
- `description` (String) Description
- `rules` (Attributes List) The ordered list of rules. Rules must be sorted in the order of the corresponding categories, if they have `category_name`. Uncategorized non-mandatory rules must be below all other rules. The first matching rule is selected. Except for MONITOR rules, the system does not continue to evaluate traffic against additional rules after that traffic matches a rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

- `log_end` (Boolean) Indicates whether the device will log events at the end of the connection. If 'MONITOR' action is selected for access rule, log_end must be true.
- `rule_type` (String) Indicates whether the rule is prefilter rule or tunnel rule.
- `send_events_to_fmc` (Boolean) Indicates whether the device will send events to the Firepower Management Center event viewer. If 'MONITOR' action is selected for access rule, send_events_to_fmc must be true.
- `send_syslog` (Boolean) Indicates whether the alerts associated with the access rule are sent to syslog.
- `snmp_config_id` (String) UUID of the SNMP alert associated with the access rule. Can be set only when either log_begin or log_end is true.
- `syslog_config_id` (String) UUID of the syslog config. Can be set only when send_syslog is true and either log_begin or log_end is true. If not set, the default policy syslog configuration in Access Control Logging applies.
- `syslog_severity` (String) Override the Severity of syslog alerts.
